This game is in a Game-Jam theme that Meta.AI suggested to me.
"RPG-Endless Runner Hybrid": Merge RPG character progression with endless runner gameplay.

Meta.AI created an idea and started writing the code for me.
I asked: "Create a game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that is playable on mobile (no keyboard needed), and in portrait mode. The game is called "RPG Endless Runner”, which will Merge RPG character progression with endless runner gameplay. If you can’t use images, maybe try drawing simple shapes for now. If possible, use Object-oriented programming, and tell me the folder structure. Thanks!"

Meta.AI generated HTML, CSS, and JS code, and I noticed it used keyboard controls, so I asked it for some modifications.
Meta.AI also gave this game description:

Gameplay Mechanics:
1. The player automatically moves forward.
2. Tap the screen to jump.
3. Avoid red enemies and jump on green obstacles.
4. Score increases every second.
5. Game over when colliding with an enemy.
Improvements:
1. Implement RPG character progression (leveling up, upgrading stats).
2. Add power-ups and items.
3. Increase difficulty over time.
4. Implement sound effects and music.
This is a basic implementation, and you can improve and expand upon it.
Let me know if you need further clarification or modifications.
